Johanna Karras : Contributed to programming the player constructor, the heuristic functions, and doMove in Part 1. Contributed to debugging, commenting, and writing up the ReadMe in Part 2.

Alveera Khan : Created the github repository, contributed to programming/debugging doMove in part 1, and programming minimax in Part 2.


Strategies for success: 
1. Fine tuning the heuristic function/ table of values in Part 1 through extensive testing to find the ideal ratio of values of cells.
2. Implemented minimax decision tree with recursive capabilities to effectively find the max score for current player and min score for opponent (alpha beta pruning). This way, it finds the optimum value possible from its current position in the tree.
3. Implemented cutoffs in the functions to optimize run time. For example, when beta < alpha or when no moves are available.
